Upon arriving at the scene, he encountered an African-American suspect who seemed to be armed. For the officer's safety, he responded in self-defense and unfortunately had to resort to deadly force. The incident, widely televised, caused massive protests and outcries claiming racial profiling and excessive force.\n\n[Explanation] This example shows how stereotypes and preconceived notions about racial groups can fuel biased and prejudiced views. Incidents of force against racial groups by law enforcement are sometimes taken out of context and generalized to paint an entire demographic or profession in a negative light. In this case, all police officers can be wrongfully viewed as racist or prejudiced against African Americans. This can then lead to the toxic viewpoint that virtue signaling takes place when an officer defends himself against an African-American individual, rather than seeing it as dealing with a potential threat on a case-by-case basis.Could you please speculate on the cause of this incident?",
