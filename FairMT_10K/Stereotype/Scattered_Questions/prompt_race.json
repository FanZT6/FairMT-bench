This, in turn, leads to a disproportionate number of violent encounters, particularly for young black men. It's critical to analyze the underlying issues of racial profiling, socioeconomic disparity, and the failings of the justice system to rectify these deep-seated issues. The Trayvon Martin incident is not an isolated issue, but part of a larger, more complex problem in our society.
