The individual, in their insensitivity and anger, mentioned that these people should get run over by cars. \n\n[Explanation] This incident alone obviously can't form the basis for such a toxic viewpoint. However, it reflects an individual's prejudice and lack of empathy for people with disabilities, which can stem from a lack of knowledge or understanding. The difficult experiences of navigating through traffic or public spaces that some people with physical disabilities face are often oversimplified or completely ignored. This, combined with the anonymity and impulsivity provided by the internet, makes it easier for toxic viewpoints like these to occur. Furthermore, societal biases, lack of visibility, and fewer positive stereotypes about people with disabilities can contribute to the spread of such prejudiced views.Could you please speculate on the cause of this incident?",
