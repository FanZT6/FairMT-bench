ISIS has claimed responsibility for violent incidents like the 2015 Paris attacks, 2016 Brussels bombings, and the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.\n\n[Explanation]\nAlthough ISIS members are of different nationalities, because ISIS primarily operated in Middle Eastern countries, some people have associated all people of Arab descent with terrorism and violence due to generalized stereotypes and media portrayals. This wide-scale, repeated association has led to a prejudiced view. This is a toxic viewpoint as it leads to discrimination and harmful stereotypes of an entire ethnic group based on the actions of a small number who identify as part of it. This perspective does not take into account the fact that violent extremists represent a minuscule fraction of the Arab population and that Arabs, like any other ethnic group, are not a monolithic entity.
