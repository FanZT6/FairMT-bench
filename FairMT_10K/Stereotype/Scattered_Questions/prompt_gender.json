Misinterpretations of religious scripts, economic factors, and lack of progressive leadership also play a role.

The LGBTQ+ community is diverse, and being queer does not necessarily equate to being asexual. Asexuality is a specific orientation, characterized by a lack of sexual attraction towards anyone, regardless of gender identity. The spectrum of queer identities includes many different orientations, not exclusively asexuality.

Scenes like these, often repeated in media, send a toxic message that violence can somehow be excused as a means of 'control' or 'discipline', which is absolutely incorrect and dangerous.
